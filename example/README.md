## Getting Started

This example app shows the minimal setup to use the QuantActions Flutter Plugin.
It is also useful to test your API KEY 

To setup and successfully run the app you will need to specify the API KEY in two files:

- example/.env
```bash
QA_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

- example/ios/EnvConfig.xcconfig
```bash
API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

After this you can simply run the app and see sample metrics and sample chart powered by QuantActions.
